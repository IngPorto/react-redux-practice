# react-redux-practice
Practice using reactjs and redux

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install
```
```bash
$ npm build
```
```bash
$ npm start:dev
```

Now you can access to `localhost:8080`

The script `build` allows to rebuild with webpack while it's coding, and `start:dev` allows to run webpack-dev-server for using the dev tools as ReactDevTool and ReduxDevTool

#### Note
> It's require Redux DevTool for Chrome
